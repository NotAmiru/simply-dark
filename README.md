## Issues
If any bugs present themselves that inherently affect your Steam experience, you can fix them, create a pull request and become a contributor/developer. 
You can also create an issue and might be fixed for you. 

## Customization
Simply dark allows you to customize some parts of the Steam client component. For now, there are 7 customization options available.

1. **Color Settings**: Controls the color used in the theme.
1. **Compacted Header**: Allows you to put the _"Store, Library, and Community"_ bar into one single row above with the Steam logo.
1. **Wallet visibility**: Allows you to hide the wallet amount from user menu.
1. **URL visibility**: Allows you to hide the URL bar when browsing inside the Steam client.
1. **"What's New" visibility**: Allows you to hide recent updates and news from the games you own inside the library page.
1. **Friends Outline**: Allows you show the friends status in friends tab via outline in the avatar.
1. **Steam News Visibility**: Allows you hide the "megaphone" (steam news) icon on top right.

## Contributing
The theme itself does not require anything being built, but to edit the theme you have to launch Steam with -dev mode.
This allows you to open the inspector on the Steam window, which allows you to edit CSS classes that you will forward to the theme.
